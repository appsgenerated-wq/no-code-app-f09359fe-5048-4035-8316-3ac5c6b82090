# FoodieFinds - A Manifest-Powered Food App

This is a complete full-stack food ordering application built with React and a Manifest backend. It provides a simple interface for users to view restaurants and for restaurant owners to manage their establishments.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user signup and login.
- **Restaurant Management**: Users can create, view, update, and delete their own restaurants.
- **Public Restaurant Listings**: All users can view a list of all available restaurants.
- **Menu Management**: (Via Admin Panel) Add and manage menu items for each restaurant.
- **Order System**: (Via API/Admin Panel) Users can place orders.
- **Role-Based Access**: Clear separation of permissions for regular users and restaurant owners using Manifest policies.
- **Automatic Admin Panel**: A complete admin interface is auto-generated by Manifest for easy data management.

## Backend (Manifest)

The backend is defined in `manifest.yml` and includes the following entities:

- **User**: Authenticable entity for managing users, roles, and authentication.
- **Restaurant**: Represents a restaurant, linked to a user owner.
- **MenuItem**: Represents a food item, linked to a restaurant.
- **Order**: Represents a customer order, linked to the customer.

Policies are configured to ensure users can only manage their own data (`condition: self`), while public data like restaurant listings are readable by anyone.

## Frontend (React)

The frontend is a single-page application built with React and Vite. It communicates with the backend exclusively through the `@mnfst/sdk`.

- **No Custom API Code**: All data fetching and mutations are handled by the Manifest SDK.
- **No Custom State Management**: Simple React `useState` and `useEffect` hooks manage the application state.
- **Styling**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.

## Getting Started

This application is designed to be deployed on the Manifest platform.

1.  **Deploy the Backend**: Deploy this project to Manifest. The `manifest.yml` file will be used to provision the database, API, and admin panel.
2.  **Run the Frontend**: The React application will be automatically built and served.
3.  **Access the App**: Open the provided application URL in your browser.
